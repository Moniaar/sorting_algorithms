# Sorting_algorithms
### What is big O notaion? ###
It is a way to analyze the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their time and space complexity. It expresses the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate. Instead of using mathmatical operations or numbers, computer scientist implemented this way to describe the run time of any code and test its effiecnecy on the long term. Understanding these sorting algorithms is crucial for optimizing code performance.
<h4>
  Bubble Sort:
</h4>
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case.
It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
<h4>Insertion Sort:</h4>
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case.
It builds the final sorted array one element at a time, taking each element and inserting it into its correct position.
<h4>Selection Sort:</h4>
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case.
It sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
<h4>
  Quick Sort:
</h4>
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, but average-case time complexity is O(n log n).
It's a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays.
